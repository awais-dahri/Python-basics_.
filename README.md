# My Computer Science Learning Journey 🚀

Hello! My name is **Awais**, and I’m a student from Sindh, Pakistan.  
This repository tracks my **daily progress in Python and problem-solving**, as I prepare for my goal of studying **Computer Science at the University of Oxford**.

## Purpose of this Repository
- Build strong Python and coding fundamentals
- Develop consistency and discipline in learning
- Keep a public record of my growth and reflections

## Daily Progress
- **Day 1:** First Python program on GitHub (`print("Hello GitHub, this is Awais")`)  
- **Day 2:** Learned Python basics – variables and simple outputs  
- **Day 3:** Added this README to clearly explain purpose and plan

## Why This Matters
I focus on **real learning and consistency** rather than shortcuts.  
This repository represents my **step-by-step efforts** and genuine progress.

## Future Plan
- Python: data structures, algorithms, small projects  
- Mathematics: MAT-style problem solving  
- Continue building a clean, structured, public GitHub profile

## Day 4 Progress
- Practiced Python conditional statements (if / elif / else)
- Wrote a simple age category program using logic
