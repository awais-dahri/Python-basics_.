# Oxford CS Preparation Journey 🚀

Hi, I’m **Awais** from Pakistan.  
This repository documents my **daily Computer Science learning journey** as part of my long-term goal to study **Computer Science at the University of Oxford**.

## 🎯 Purpose
- Build strong programming fundamentals
- Develop consistency and discipline
- Create public proof of learning and growth

## 📅 Daily Progress
- **Day 1:** Introduction to Python & GitHub  
- **Day 2:** Python basics (variables, simple output)  
- **Day 3:** Repository documentation & structure

## 🧠 Why this matters
I believe consistency, reflection, and problem-solving matter more than shortcuts.  
This repository represents **real effort, not fake streaks**.

## 🔮 Future Plan
- Python (DSA, problem solving)
- Mathematics (MAT-style logic)
- Small projects
- Open-source & learning reflections

📌 _Started in 2026 with a long-term vision._
